# KDE customization

## Resize window to fixed size and position with Meta+X

I have three Lenovo monitors, each 1920x1200, turned to portraits, so 1200x1920, making up a desktop of 3600x1920 pixels.

Zooming windows in KDE only zooms them to one screen at a time.

This is my simplistic approach to resize a window onto the whole multiscreen desktop.
